# About UPower

UPower is an abstraction for enumerating power devices, listening to device
events and querying power history and statistics. Any application or service on
the system can access the org.freedesktop.UPower service via the system message
bus.

UPower also does auto-s3|s4|s5 on critical low battery events.
